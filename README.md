## Architecture Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion - Azure Data Lake Storage
- Source data is stored in **Azure Data Lake**.

### 2️⃣ Data Orchestration - Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- **ADF** automates the end-to-end process.
- **Metadata File Check**:
  - If missing, an **error email notification** is triggered.
  - If present, metadata parameters are extracted.
- **Data Copying**:
  - Extracts files from the **client’s Data Lake**.
  - Stores them in a **centralized storage Data Lake**.

### 3️⃣ Data Processing - Azure Databricks & PySpark
- Securely connects to **Azure Data Lake** using **Azure Key Vault & Databricks scopes**.
- Reads raw data files and uploads them to the workspace.
- Processes data using **PySpark Notebooks**:
  - Cleans and resolves data inconsistencies.
  - Applies transformations and enrichment.
  - Creates **Delta Tables** for optimized storage and querying.

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization - Power BI
- **Power BI** connects to **cleaned Delta Tables**.
- Implements business logic using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**.
- Builds an **interactive dashboard** for insightful data exploration.
